Project-EfficentMergeSort
===============================

project for efficient merge sorting algorithm 


I implemented merge sorting using the three versions

1.	Merge sort: sorted using Allocate dynamic memory for L and R within Merge.
2.	Better sort: using a single auxiliary array B in main and pass it to MergeSort and Merge. In each instance of Merge, data is copied from A to B and merged back into A.

3.	EvenBetterSort: using a single auxiliary array B in main and pass it to MergeSort and Merge. Data alternates between A and B.
